# TODO:

#### add methods to calls. example: requests.get("something") --> requests.get("something").text ...
#### replace calls with their return values. example: print(add(1,2)) --> print(3) --> 3
#### look for blocks inside blocks
#### eval blocks

# Currently:

#### every new call/variable... must be in a new line
#### you can't use double quotes inside a double quote string, same thing as single quotes. (can be fixed with a better regex)
#### you need to use double quotes inside a dictionary just like json.
